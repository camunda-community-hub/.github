# Welcome to the Camunda Community Hub!
The Camunda Community Hub is a project to empower our open source community extension maintainers, and encourage new contributors to get started contributing to the Camunda open source ecosystem. 

Extensions in the Camunda Community Hub organization are independently led and maintained projects by members of the broader Camunda open source community, some of whom happen to be Camunda employees, or are projects/tutorials that are created and maintained by the Camunda Developer Relations team!

> :warning: Camunda extensions found in the Camunda Community Hub are maintained by the community and are not part of the commercial Camunda product. Camunda does not support community extensions as part of its commercial services to enterprise customers.
