# Welcome to the Camunda Community Hub!
A project to empower our open source community extension maintainers, and encourage new contributors to get started contributing to the Camunda open source ecosystem. 

Extensions in the Camunda Community Hub organization are independently led and maintained projects by members of the broader Camunda open source community, some of whom happen to be Camunda employees, or are projects/tutorials that are created and maintained by the Camunda Developer Relations team!

With the Camunda Community Hub, we want to empower our open source community to contribute, and encourage new contributors to get started contributing to the Camunda open source ecosystem.
