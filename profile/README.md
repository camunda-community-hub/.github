# The Camunda Community Hub

The Camunda Community Hub is Camunda's GitHub Organization for community contributed extensions. Those extensions are independently maintained by members of the Camunda open source community (with some maintainers happen to be Camunda employees too).

With the Camunda Community Hub we want to empower our open source community to contribute, and encourage new contributors to get started contributing to the Camunda open source ecosystem.

## Existing community extensions

You can find a list of existing community extensions by [browsing the repostories](https://github.com/orgs/camunda-community-hub/repositories) in this GitHub organization.

## How to prepare a Java project for the Camunda Community Hub?

If you develop a Java project, you can leverage the existing infrastructure for builds and releases to Maven Central.

- Use a Maven Group Id based on: `org.camunda.community`
- Add release parent pom ([as described here](https://github.com/camunda-community-hub/community-action-maven-release)):

```xml
<parent>
    <groupId>org.camunda.community</groupId>
    <artifactId>community-hub-release-parent</artifactId>
    <version>1.2.2</version>
</parent>
```

- Add Github Action [as decribed here](https://github.com/camunda-community-hub/community-action-maven-release#add-github-workflow). Check that the build is working when you push code to your repo. 

- When you are ready to release, follow [performing a release](https://github.com/camunda-community-hub/community/blob/main/RELEASE.MD#performing-a-release).
